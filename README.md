# Angular VS React

I want to check with frameworks is more friendly, functional, and even fun. And for that I wanted to build something more that just a Todo list.

## Project
A small version of Twitter:

* **/**
  * Login page.
  * Sign in page.

* **/feed**

  * Shows all the tweets of an user
  * Allows the user to create a new Tweet
  * Allows the user to like and unlike tweets

* **/users**
  * List of all users
  * Current user can follow/unfollow users

* **/users/id**
  * Shows info about an user
  * Current user can follow/unfollow this user

* **/likes**
  * List of all liked tweets by the current user
    * Doesn't matter if the user follows or not a user
  * Current user can like/unlike tweets
